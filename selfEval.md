# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - I felt comfortable with the assignments in this CFU. Everything was straight forward and I didn't find it difficult to apply concepts from previous lessons.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - So far so good. It hasn't been a struggle so far to stay focused and incorperate breaks. I have a strong desire to be working on the material opposed to the myriad of other things I could be doing. We will see how that develops when the workload increases exponentially in MOD1.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    - I'm not sure if this is %100 correct but it seems that the only way to print individual keys or values from an object is to first assign those keys or values to their own array. Very interested to see if there's another way to do this.
